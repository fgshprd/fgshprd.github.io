title: iOS7 History Swipes And Click Events
---

{{ page.title }}
================

While working on a project at work, I noticed the following strange behavior on our iPhone 5c's and 5s's running iOS7 (iPhone 4's running iOS7 don't seem to be affected; I haven't tried it on a plain iPhone 5): If you preventDefault on touchend events against the document object (e.g., to prevent scrolling while a modal window is open), click events on objects in the history-swipe areas along the left and right sides of the screen will not register. Click events elsewhere will register. This goes for onclick handlers as well as script URL's (i.e., href="javascript:..."). 

[Here's a demo page]({{ site.url }}/files/ios7touchExample.html) that will demonstrate the issue; remember, it must be viewed on an iPhone 5c/5s device running iOS7. The large rectangle in the upper middle will log interactions. The small vertical rectangles are your click targets. I made them skinny so that the ones on the left and right would fit completely inside the history-swipe areas of the screen.
