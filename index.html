                I recently taught a course on The Singularity for The Brooklyn Institute for Social Research. I've received some requests for the syllabus, so I thought I'd post it here. The copy is below and a pdf version is here.

                <h2>The Singularity: Artificial Intelligence and the Post-Human Future</h2>
                
                <p>Frank Shepard<br>
                Brooklyn Institute for Social Research<br>
                January 30 - February 20, 2019</p>
                
                <p>Alan Turing, whose Turing Test set the initial standard for artificial intelligence, mused towards the end of his life
                on the prospects of a truly superintelligent machine: “it seems probable that once the machine thinking method had
                started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers…At some stage therefore we should have to expect the
                machines to take control…” Such a scenario, seemingly implicit in the very concept of artificial intelligence, we now
                call “the Singularity”—a technological regime, as futurist Vernor Vinge puts it, “as radically different from our human
                past as we humans are from the lower animals.” For some, the prospect is potentially liberatory; for others, it’s an
                existential threat; for others still, it’s simply unlikely. What is “the Singularity,” and what intellectual tools might
                we use to interrogate it?</p>
                
                <p>In this course, students will approach these fundamental questions through a series of smaller investigations. First, we
                will explore the foundational texts on the subject by Turing, Vernor Vinge, I.J. Good, Ray Kurzweil, Nick Bostrom, and
                others. Then, we will consider “the Singularity” within a broader intellectual horizon from a number of angles. For
                instance, given what we know now about computation and human intelligence, is this idea technologically feasible? If so,
                on what time scale? What are the underlying philosophical assumptions and how might we assess them? Is the concept of
                the Singularity truly novel, or does it have roots in previous philosophical, political, or religious efforts to
                liberate the mind from the “limitations” of the flesh? Furthermore, how should we understand “the Singularity” movement
                in relation to alternative, contemporary attempts to understand the role and importance of the body for technological
                efforts to transcend it? Students will consider these and related questions through a close reading of selections taken
                from a diverse set of disciplines and critical perspective such as the philosophy of computation, feminist theory, the
                philosophy of transhumanism (and its critics), phenomenology, theology, and religious studies.</p>

                <h3>Week 2 (February 6)</h3>

                Key questions:
                How does Kurzweil support his argument that the Singularity will occur?
                E.g., what is exponential growth and how is it significant for Kurzweil’s claims?
                What qualities of “the human” are of interest to Kurzweil, i.e., what is retained, what lost as we transition to a
                post-human existence?
