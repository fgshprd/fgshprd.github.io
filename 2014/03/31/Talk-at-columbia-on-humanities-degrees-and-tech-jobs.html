<p><em>These are notes I prepared for a talk delivered to a group of graduate students at Columbia University on March 31, 2014. The text of the event’s announcement can be <a href="#event">found below</a>.</em></p>

<p>I’m going to attempt to address the topic at hand by breaking it down into 3 short questions followed by my responses.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What do I do?</strong><br />
I write software for the mobile web. This means that I build, maintain, and test programs that run on a variety of devices all over the world. Since I started in my current position, code I have written has been delivered to many millions of people – something I could never say about my academic work. Of course, none of them have read it, but a good number have interacted with it.</p>

    <p>During any given work day, I spend my time translating business requirements into logical routines that will play out on handheld computers. I also spend a good deal of time tracking down bugs, meaning that I have to locate weak points in our current logic and find ways to fix them. This work can be rewarding in a number of ways: I get to experience the rush of the “a-ha” moment at least several times a day. I enjoy building things, solving problems, and making things work. With software engineering, you see the results of your efforts almost immediately. I work on a problem and can know within minutes if my solution is correct. I find this kind of rapid feedback very satisfying. Also, because my background is in philosophy, I’ve been devoting much of my free time to learning more about the intersection of computer science and modern philosophy. Consequently, I’m not totally divorced from the interests I pursued as a student. In fact, those interests probably predisposed me to my career.</p>

    <p>This brings me to the next question on my list …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How has my education prepared me for this work?</strong><br />
I’m not going to pretend that the study of religion has prepared me in any specific way for the work I do as a technologist. I have been interested in computers and programming since I was a child, and I’ve worked on and off for many years as a web developer. (In fact, this is how I have been able to avoid the crippling debt often associated with grad school. My debt is merely hobbling.) So I want to be clear up-front that my story is probably most relevant for those of you who have some background or strong interest in technology. If you’re interested in this path, you ought to be a passionate amateur, at least.</p>

    <p>That said, I have been able to work in technology without any formal training in computer science, programming, or design, and this is why I wanted to participate today. I have made a career out of skills that I have acquired on my own outside of any formal institution. This was possible, in part, because demand for skilled IT workers has outpaced supply for many years – the reverse of the situation in which most academics find themselves. But the availability of opportunities to people like me is also due to the relative openness of the larger tech community. Unlike most others, my adoptive industry, at this point in time, does not <em>insist</em> on any particular set of formal qualifications, degrees, or training. By and large, you are assessed through an informal system of peer review. You must be able to walk the walk, and talk the talk, but most of the time no one cares how you came to acquire these skills. It doesn’t matter whether you taught yourself using blog posts, books, and forums, or you went through a rigorous academic program. You can put your work on the web for free, and participate in the community for free. Demonstrate that you have the right skills and you will probably find a job. I find this openness enormously attractive, and, as I will discuss in a moment, it carries over into the larger culture of the tech community.</p>

    <p>Given this general openness of the industry, and thus the value of self-discipline, of the ability to learn independently, and of the importance of communicating one’s skills and knowledge, it is not difficult to imagine how training in the humanities might confer an advantage on the amateur technologist seeking an opportunity to become a professional. For instance, engineering work requires the patience to stick with a tough problem until a solution is found; a passion for learning new things and discussing them with their peers; the ability to discriminate between good and bad sources; and communication skills that enable one to share her ideas clearly and to instruct others in their use. Each of these skills is important in software development, and individuals who have successfully completed a graduate program in any of the humanities have had to master tham all – often to a degree that surpasses that attained by someone whose training is limited to engineering. Someone who has the requisite technical skills but also has earned a graduate degree in the humanities is likely to be an exceptionally good fit for this kind of work.</p>

    <p>Another advantage conferred by a graduate education in the humanities is that your graduate degree will help you stand out in the job market. This was perhaps the most suprising thing I experienced as I made the transition. I cannot tell you how many times I’ve been approached by a recruiter who was intrigued by my background. This was true during my job interviews, too. I’ve found that having a good personal story – being an interesting and interested person – counts for a lot. You’d also be surprised how many of the people who might interview you are also students of the humanities. The technology industry – particularly web technology – is full of academic transplants. Whatever the subject-matter, your graduate degree can provide you with a lot of social capital outside of the academy.</p>

    <p>This brings me to the final question …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>How does the tech world compare to the academic world?</strong><br />
Many of us find the academic world appealing because we love to learn and to share what we’ve learned with others. The technology community, like the academic community, is a place that encourages and rewards these values. The pace of change in technology is dizzying, so you are never short of opportunities to research new topics. As a trained researcher, you’ll probably be better at it than most of your peers. The technology community – and the open source community in particular – is simply amazing. The participants are passionate about what they do, committed to sharing their knowledge and work freely, and are extremely generous with their time and talents. There are also many opportunities to publish about your work or projects on blogs and tech publications, and their are many interesting projects open to public participation. The barrier to entry is relatively low, and the rewards can be high. So if working with web technology is something that appeals to you but you’ve thought it was not a live possibility for you because you lack a formal education, I encourage you to take another look.    </p>

<p><strong><span id="event">Event Announcement:</span></strong></p>

<p>As we all know, the study of religion has never been more important than in today’s globalized world.  In addition to research and teaching in the academy, it is important for people working in government, NGOs, social organizations, secondary education, business, finance, journalism, media, and the arts to understand different languages, cultures, and religions.</p>

<p>On March 31st at 5:00, a group of distinguished professionals from a variety of fields will join us for a discussion of possibilities for non-academic careers for people with advanced degrees in religion.  Each person will offer brief comments on his or her personal trajectory and will discuss professional opportunities for people with degrees in religion.  There will also be ample time for questions and discussion.  Our guests for this event will be:</p>

<p>Ari Bergmann, <em>Penso Advisors, LLC</em><br />
Josh Eisen, <em>Founder and Director, Morningside Translations</em><br />
Lisa Miller, <em>formerly Newsweek, currently New York Magazine</em><br />
George Rupp, <em>President Emeritus, Columbia University; former director of International Rescue Committee</em><br />
Frank Shepard, <em>Engineer, Crisp Media</em></p>
